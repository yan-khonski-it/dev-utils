Some tools I need to use on a macbook.

## fix-wifi
When I move my macbook from office to home office connecting to different wi-fi end-points or / and different VPM, mac would connect to wi-fi.

- Turn off wi-fi on mac

```commandline
sudo python3 ./fix_wifi.py
```

- Reboot
- Turn on wi-fi (but it can be on after reboot).
